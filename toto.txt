First:
1. Complete All required endpoints (Popular people etc) -----------------DONE-------------------
2. Add integration test for all of them
3. Add unit tests for all of them
4. Prepare api doc for all the endpoints [Not very important]


Second:
Refactor(Optimize) service <-> controller code


Third:
Finish User model and routes (with unit & integration tests)

Fourth:
1. Add functionality to CRUD for Lists
2. Add Default Lists (Watchlist, Favourites)

Sixth:
1. Create Admin routes (with unit & integration tests)
2. Add Authorization for admin routes

Add 3rd party auth




Additional suggestions:

Consider adding request specs to ensure API consistency
Add response serializers if the JSON structure needs to be customized
Add pagination support if needed
Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data
Add request validation using strong parameters
Consider using JSON:API format for consistent API responses





Recommendations:

Add These:

rack-cors if this is an API for web clients
A serializer gem if you need structured JSON responses
annotate for model annotations
simplecov for test coverage
vcr and webmock if you're making external API calls in tests


Consider Removing:

thruster unless you specifically need its features
tzinfo-data if you're not on Windows
solid_cable if you're not using WebSocket


Consider Adding:

pagy or kaminari for pagination
redis if you need caching/job queue
httparty or faraday for HTTP requests
jwt if you need token authentication
oj for faster JSON parsing
strong_migrations for safer migrations
